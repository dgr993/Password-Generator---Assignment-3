# Password-Generator---Assignment-3

This is a password creator. A user inputs a set of parameters they desire the password have by answering confirmation questions. I then generated through javascript the creation of the password they asked for. 

I enjoyed most the colaboration of working with my TA and my fellow group mates as we put our heads together to all help with some aspect of the project. I love when we each bring the whole group up together and no one is left behind. 

I have been wanting to make a password generator and I found the most difficult part adjusting to the language of javascript seeing it was a little more ambiguous and less straight forward to hmtl and css for me.
